      <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
      <div class="card p-4 shadow-sm">
        <p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>GP demand now averages <strong>25.8M appointments/month</strong> ‚Äì 15% above pre-COVID levels</li>
          <li>Clinics operate at <strong>115% of planned capacity</strong> ‚Äì no slack for shocks</li>
          <li><strong>4.7% of capacity is lost</strong> to missed appointments (DNA), mainly from short-notice and remote bookings</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Board-level actions:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Target DNA hotspots</strong> ‚Äì SMS reminders for bookings ‚â§ 7 days</li>
          <li><strong>Rebalance staffing</strong> ‚Äì Shift resources to high-demand ICBs and manage seasonal peaks</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor sentiment</strong> ‚Äì Track hashtags like #NHSCrisis and #ThankYouNHS weekly</li>

  <h2> Dashboard Highlights</h2>

  <h5 class="mt-4">KPIs Overview</h5>
  <img src="Dashboard_KPI.png" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-2" alt="KPI Dashboard">
  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    This dashboard summarises key NHS performance indicators from August 2021 to June 2022. Clinics handled an average of 25.8 million appointments/month, with a peak of 29.1 million in November. Face-to-face care still made up 61.7% of visits, while 90.7% of all appointments were delivered by GPs. The missed appointment (DNA) rate was 4.69%. Significant regional inequality is visible: Cornwall led with 6,201 appointments per 1,000 people, while South East London trailed at just 3,850.
  </p>

  <h5>Capacity Utilisation vs Planning Limit</h5>
  <img src="Dashboard_Capacity.png" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-2" alt="Capacity Chart">
  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    NHS services consistently operated over capacity. Monthly utilisation breached 100% regularly, reaching a critical 120% in October 2021. Even quieter months stayed close to full, confirming structural overuse rather than temporary surges. This supports the case for flexible staffing and strategic surge planning.
  </p>

  <h5>Detailed Capacity Utilisation</h5>
<img src="Dashboard_Utilization.png" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-2" alt="Utilisation Detail Chart">
<p class="text-muted fst-italic">
  This chart offers a more granular view of how NHS appointment volumes exceeded planned capacity across regions and time.
  Persistent over-utilisation beyond 100% confirms that system pressure is not isolated to seasonal peaks but reflects an ongoing resource gap.
  This visual supports arguments for structural staffing reforms and flexible surge management.
</p>


  <h5>Missed Appointments Trends</h5>
  <img src="Dashboard_Missed.png" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-2" alt="Missed Appointments Chart">
  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    Monthly missed appointments (DNAs) ranged between 4.2% and 5.18%, with an October 2021 spike of over 1.5 million no-shows. Logistic regression confirmed that short-notice bookings (especially same-day) and remote formats like telephone/video were the strongest predictors of DNA risk.
  </p>

     <section class="my-5">
  <h2>üìà Appointment Volume by Season</h2>

  <p>
    Seasonal variation plays a significant role in NHS service pressure. The bar charts below compare total and average 
    monthly appointments by season across the dataset timeframe (Aug 2021‚ÄìJun 2022).
  </p>

  <img src="Dashboard_Season.png" alt="Seasonal Appointment Volume" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-3">

  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    Autumn and Winter had the highest appointment volumes, with Autumn peaking at nearly 90 million. This aligns with post-lockdown recovery 
    and seasonal illness trends. June and August, as standalone months, saw noticeably lower volume, consistent with holiday effects.
  </p>

  <h2> Predicting Missed Appointments</h2>

  <p>
    To better understand what increases the likelihood of missed appointments (DNA), I trained a logistic regression model 
    using post-lockdown appointment data. The chart below shows the odds ratios for various predictors.
  </p>

  <img src="Dashboard_Regression.png" alt="Logistic Regression Odds Ratios" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-3">

  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    This analysis revealed that telephone and video/online appointments had a significantly higher likelihood of being missed, 
    compared to face-to-face. Weekday and lead time (days_before_appointment) also influenced DNA risk. The model's AUC score was 0.569, 
    suggesting moderate predictive power. These insights can support targeted interventions like reminders for short-notice or remote bookings.

<section class="my-5">
  <h2>Public Sentiment from Twitter</h2>

  <p>
    In addition to internal NHS data, Twitter posts mentioning NHS-related keywords were analysed using sentiment scoring 
    and hashtag frequency. This helped contextualize public discourse around healthcare access and perception.
  </p>

  <h5>Public Sentiment ‚Äì Twitter Hashtags</h5>
  <img src="Dashboard_Twitter.png" class="img-fluid rounded border mb-2" alt="Twitter Hashtags">
  <p class="text-muted fst-italic">
    Twitter sentiment focused heavily on general healthcare (#healthcare), digital transformation (#digitalhealth, #AI), and workforce challenges (#job, #staffing). These trends aligned with NHS performance dips and policy moments, validating social media as a real-time feedback loop for public trust and system strain.
